## Chapter Introduction to the Internet Protocol

### Objectives

1.1 Compare and contrast the Open Systems iNterconnection (OSI) model layers and encapsulation concepts
1.5 Explain common ports and protocols, their application, and encrypted alternatives

### Exam Essentials

- Remember the Process/Application layer protocols
- Understand data encapsulation and decapsulation within the OSI model context
- Be able to explain common ports and protocols, their application, and encrypted alternatives
- Be able to identify and define protocol types
- Remember the Host-to-Host layer Protocols
- Remember the Internet layer protocols

### DoD (Department of Defense) Layer

- Process Application - controls protocols for for nod-eto-node application communication and also controls user-interface specifications
- Host-to-Host - Similar to the OSI model transportation layer handling transmission service for applications, end-to-end communication and ensuring the error-free delivery of data. It handles packet sequencing and data integrity 
- Internet - Handles logical transmission of packets, routing based on logical IP addressing
- Network Access - Monitors data exchange between the host and the network. It identifies hardware addressing and physical transmission of data

### Common Ports and Protocols

| Protocol | Port or Port Range | Use Case |

| sequenced | Unsequenced |
| Reliable | Unreliable |
| Connection-orientated | | Connectionless |
| Virtual Circuit | Low overhead |
| Acknowledgements | No Acknowledgements |
| Windowing flow control | No flow control |

### TCP (Transmission Control Protocol)

Transmission Control Protocol is a huge backbone of the internet and ensuring packets are received int he correct order and in their complete state. 

TCP Headers are 60 bytes consisting of data laid out as such

- Source Port - this is the port number of the application on the host sending the data
- Destination Port - This is the port number of the application requested on the destination host
- Sequence Number a number used by TCP that puts the data back in the correct order or retransmits missing or damaged data during a process called sequencing
- Acknowledgement Number - the value is the TCP octet that is expected next
- Header Length - the number of 32-bit words in the TCP header, which indicates where the data begins
- Reserved - Always set to zer
- Code Bits/TCP Flags - Controls functions used to set up and terminate a session
- Window - The window size the sender is willing to accept in octets
- Checksum - the cyclic redundancy check (CRC), used becaue TCP doesn't trust lower layers and checks everything. The CRc checks the header and the data fields.
- Urgent - A valid field only if the urgent pointer in the code bits is set. 
- Options - May be 0, meaning no options present, or multiples of 32 bits.
- Payload - the data

### User Datagram Protocol (UDP)

UDP sends packets without care for sequencing or whether the targeted destination actually received the packets. It will continue to send packets regardless. UDP is called a connectionless protocol.

UDP Segment typically has the below data in only 8 bytes versus TCP's 60 bytes

- Source Port
- Destination Port
- Checksum
- Length
- Data

### IP (Internet Protocol)

Internet Protocol Header in total 20 bytes or 160 bits

| Header Name | Description | Bits |
|-------------|-------------|-----|
| Version - IP Version Number | 4 |
| Header Length | Header length (HLEN) in 32-bit words | 4 |
| Priority and Type of Service | first three bits are priority bits, which tells the type of service how the datagram should be handled | 8 |
| Total Length | Length of the packet, including header and data | 16 |
| Identification | Unique IP-packet value used to differentiate fragmented packets from different datagram | 16 |
| Flags | this one field specifies whether fragmentation of the packet should occur | 3 | 
| Fragment Offset | Allows for different Maximum Transmission Units (MTUs) and breaks up packets into different fragments if they are too large for one frame | 13 |
| Time to Live | Number of Seconds or Number of hops the packet can make before it has expired and no longer is forwarded to the destination host | 8 |
| Protocol | Port of upper layer protocol such as TCP or UDP ports, or Network layer protocols like ARP and ICMP | 8 |
| Header Checksum | Cyclic redundancy check (CRC) on header only | 16 |
| Source IP Address | 32-bit IP address of sending station | 32 | 
| Destination IP Address | 32-bit IP address of receiving station | 32 |
| Options | Used for network testing, debugging, security, and more | 32 |
| Data | After the IP option field, will be the upper-layer data | varies |

### Internet Control Message Protocol (ICMP)

- works at the network layer
- provides information to host about network problems
- encapsulated within IP datagram
- Common Errors
   - Destination Unreachable
   - Buffer Full
   - Hops
   - Ping
   - Traceroute

### Address Resolution Protocol (ARP)

- Finds the hardware address of a host from a known IP address
- Host systems use this protocol to map between a hardware address on the network and an IP address
- Works as IP's detective to find out where the destination is on the network

### Reverse Address Resolution Protocol (RARP)

- discovers the identify of the IP address for diskless machines by sending out packet that includes its MAC address and request for the IP address assigned to that MAC address. The RARP server responds with the correct information.

### Generic Routing Encapsulation

- Generic Routing Encapsulation is a way of creating a virtual IP point-to-point tunnel for any protocol that may be denied by either end. 
- It is protocol agnostic
- Simply a way to create an unencrypted tunnel between two networks

### Internet Protocol Security (IPSec)

- IPSec is a way of ensuring data integrity and encryption so the data is not sent in plain text.
- Secure VPN Tunnels are creating using GRE and IPSec

### Authentication Header (AH)/Encapsulating Security Payload (ESP)

- IPSec uses the authentication header as a way of validating a packet
- A one way hash is created on either side of the network and matched when received. If the packet does not match it is dropped.

### Encapsulating Security Payload (ESP)

- Confidentiality - ESP uses symmetric encryption at the sender end to encrypt data payloads
- Data Integrity - Data integrity allows the receiver to verify that he data received was not altered in any way along with the way. IPSec uses checksums as a simple check of the data
- Authentication - Receiver of the packet can verify the packet has been sent by whom claims to have sent it, and no one has man-in-the-middle attacked
- Anti-Replay Service - A sequence number is used to verify the packet has already been received. This so someone cannot create a copy of a packet and replay it to the destination causing havoc on the receivers end
- Traffic Flow - Tunnel flow should be enabled at a gateway to make it obscure from the outside or behind the gateway who is asking for what.

### Data Encapsulation

 - Data Encapsulation is where each layer of the OSI model wraps the current data with it's own header information so that it can be unwrapped at the same layer on the receiving end. This way each layer only needs to handle and know it's own information, unwrap, and pass the data along to the next layer.

2. FTP uses both TCP ports 20 and 21 for the data channel and the control channel, respectively
3. Both TCP and UDP
4. ICMP uses IP directly to build error-reporting packets that are transmitted back to the originating source host when issues arise during the delivery of data packets. ICMP is also used during ping and some traceroute operations
