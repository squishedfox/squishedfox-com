# CompTIA Network+ N10-008

## Book Note(s)

### Cahpter 1

#### Exam Essentials

- **Know your network topologies** Know the names and descriptions of the topologies. Be aware of the difference between physical networks (what humans see) and logical networks (what the equipment sees)
- **Know the advantages and disadvantages of the topologies** It is important to know what each topology brings to the table. Knowing the various characteristics of each topology comes in handy during troubleshooting
- **Understand the terms LAN and WAN** You need to understand when you use a LAN and whe you use a WAN. a LAN is used to connect a group of hosts together, and a WAN is used to connect various LANs together

#### Written Lab

Answers can be found at the bottom of the page

1. What are the three basic LAN topologies
2. What common WAN topology often results in multiple connections to a single site (leading to a high degree of fault tolerance) and has one-to-many connections?
3. What is the term for a device that shares its resources with other network devices?
4. What network model draws a clear distinction between devices that share their resources and devices that do not?
5. Which network topology or connection type can be implemented with only two endpoints?
6. What device is generally implemented as a star topology?
7. What does MLPLS stand for?
8. What does WAN stand for?
9. Will a computer that shares no resources most likely be connected to the backbone or to a segment?
10. Which LAN topology is characterized by all devices beign daisy-chained together with the devices at each end being connected to only other device?
