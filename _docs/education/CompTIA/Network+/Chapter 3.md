# CompTIA Network+ N10-008 Study Guide

## Chapter 3 Networking Connectors and Wiring Standards

### Objectives

1.3. Summarize the types of cables and connectors and explain which is appropriate type for a solution

### Essentials

- Understand the various types of cables used in todays networks
- Understand the various types of ends that are used on each type of cable
- Describe the various types of media converters that are available
- Understand what a T56A to T56A cable is
- Understand wht a T568A to T568B cable is
- Define the function of a T1 cross over cable

### Common Properties

- Transmission Speeds - how many bits can be transmitted per second or microsecond in some cases
- Distance - how far can a signal be transmitted without degrading
- Duplex - Whether the signals can send and receive 
- Noise Immunity (Security, EMI) - Whether the wire can or can't be tapped or spliced to listen in on traffic
- Frequency - The amount measured in MHz (Megahertz) of electrical bandwidth

### Wiring Standards
 
- T568A - Standard is commonly used with patch cables (Straight through)
- T568B - Standard is commonly used with cross over cables

### Straight Through Cabling

- Uses pints 1,2,3, and 6 to transmit data
- Used for connecting a host to a switch, hub
- Used for connecting a router to a switch or hub

### Crossover Through Cabling

- Used to connect these devices together
  - Switch to switch
  - Hub to hub
  - Host to host
  - Hub to switch
  - Router direct to host
- Connects pins 2 to 6, 1 to 3 to 1, and 6 to 2


### Coaxial Cabling

Coaxial cabling has has a physical copper center surrounded by plastic jacketing and a braided shield around it.

### Twisted Pair

Twisted pair have multiple individually shielded wires that are wrapped around each other and sometimes have a shield around the entire twisted par to make it call STP (Shielded Twisted Pair). If they do not have a Shield it's called Unshielded Twisted Pair (UTP).

Cables are twisted pairs because it reduces (cross talk) or physical electrical interference

#### UTP (Unshielded Twisted Pair) Categories

- Category 1 - Phone Wiring. Slow no longer used
- Category 2 - Four twisted wire pairs handling up to 4 Mbps with frequency limited up to 10 MHz
- Category 3 - Four twisted pairs handling up to 16 MHz and transmission speeds of up to 10 Mbps
- Category 4 - Handles up to 20 MHz
- Category 5 - Four twisted pairs used for 100BaseTX and up to 100 MHz
- Category 5e - E stands for "enhanced" category 5 enhanced wiring. Can start handling Gigabit ethernet
- Category 6 - Four twisted pairs for 1000BaseTX handling up to 250 MHz
- Category 6A - Category 6 Augmented created as a way to reduce crosstalk and handle 500 MHz (twice Category 6) and used for 10GBaseT
- Category 7 - Four twisted pairs Category 7 Cabling allows or 10 Gigabit Ethernet over 100 meters
- Category 8 - Supports 25G and 40G transmission with a distance of 30 meters. Typically used at data centers

### Twinaxial Cable

Twinaxial Cabling is used as a short distance high speed connection cable. Advantage is that it is copper based wiring so it's cheaper than fiber optic cabling

### Fiber Optic

- Uses light impulses to transmit data
- Pros
  - Immune to EMi and RFI
  - Can transmit up to 40 kilometers
- Cons
  - Expensive
  - Difficult to install
  - More expensive maintenance
  - More challenging to troubleshoot

#### Single Mode Fiber

- commonly used for long distances

#### Multi Mode Fiber

- MMF is commonly used for shorter distances

### Connector Types

- F Type of connector is used with Coaxial cabling
- RJ-11
- RJ-45 - T568B Standards have Orange/White, Orange, Green/White, Blue, Blue/White, Green, Brown/White, Brown
- UPC Connectors are used as part of fiber optic connectors and focuses the light back down into the cable which can cause db loss
- Straight Tip connector is used for fiber optic cabling and usually is terminated with a BNC attachment that can be used to hold the cable in place
- Square Connector (SC) is used for fiber optic cabling and usually terminated with a square attachment that prevents the cable from falling out
- MT-RJ Connector is a small form factor fiber optic connector
  - Small in size
  - TX and RX strands in one connector
  - Keyed for single polarity
  - Pre-terminated ends that require no polishing or epoxy
  - Easy to use

### Transceiver

- Transceivers are devices which can send and receive messages
- Examples
  - SFP+ - The small form-factor pluggable (SFP) compact module used for telecommunication and data communications
  - QSFP - The quad small form factor pluggable (QSFP) used for data communications for fiber optic cabling

### Media Converters

- Media Converters are used to change the signaling from one type such as light into electrical signals for copper or vise-versa
- Multimode Fiber to Ethernet
- Fiber to Coaxial
- Single-Mode to Multimode Fiber

### Serial Cables

- Serial Cables can read data as it is streamed in and can convert the signal into a different medium of transmission and can be read on the other end
- Parallel communication requires that signals must be batched at the converter and then transmitted together as 1s and 0s to make any sense
