# CompTIA Network+ N10-008 Study Guide

## Chapter 2

### Objectives

- 1.1 Compare and contrast the Open Systems Interconnection (OSI) model layers and encapsulation concepts
- 1.5 Explain common ports and protocol, their application, and encrypted alternatives

### Internetworking Models

- Open Systems Intercommunication (OSI) Standard was created by International Organization for Standardization (ISO)

### Layer 1 Physical Layer

- Examples: Physical Topology

Summary: Moves bits between devices and specifies voltage, wire speed, and pin-out of cables

### Layer 2 Data Link Layer

- Examples: Framing

Summary: Combines packets into bytes and bytes into frames, access to media using MAC addresses, and performs error detection, not correction

- Responsabilities: 
  - Formats messages into pieces called data frames which have a header attached which links the source and destination MAC addresses.
  - Responsabile for fingerprinting devices on a network

### Layer 3 Network Layer

- Examples: Routing

Summary: Provides logical adressing, which routers use for path determination

**Data Packets** - pieces of information moved throughout a network from source to destination

**Route-Update Pckets** - Updates about nodes in the network, their addresses, and what other nodes they are connected to

### Layer 4 Transport Layer

- Examples: End-to-end connection

Summary: Provides reliable or unreliable delivery and performs error correction before retransmition

#### TCP

Transmission Control Protocol (Connection oriented) uses a three way handshake (ACK -> SYN/ACK -> ACK) to establish a connection with a end system to send packets in a specific sequence.

**Flow control** is enabled with TCP that allows a recipient to respond with confirmation of a packet or tell the sender to wait, or slow down with sending data.

A **window** is the amount segments (measured in bytes) of which a sender can continue to send without an acknowledgement. **Windows** are used to control the amount of outstanding, unacknowledged data segments 

#### UDP

User Datagram Protocol (Connectionless) is a protocol that sends floods of packets to it's destination without the confirmation from the recipient

### Layer 5 Session Layer

- Examples: Dialog Control

Summary: Keeps different applications data separate

### Layer 6 Presenation Layer

- Examples: Data encryption, compression, and translation services

Summary: Presents the data and handles processing such as encryption

### Layer 7 Application Layer

- Examples: File, print, message, database, and application services

Summary: Provides a user interface

## Written Lab

1. Which layer chooses and determines the availability of communicating partners along with the resources necessary to make the connection, coordinates partnering applications, and forms a consensus on procedures for controlling data integrity and error recovery? 

2. Which layer is responsible for converting frames from the Data Link Layer into electrical signals?

3. At which layer is routing implemented, enabling connections and path selection between two end systems

4. Which layer defines how data is formatted, presented, encoded, and converted?

5. What layer is responsible for creating, managing, and terminating sessions between applications?

6. Which layer manages the transmission of data cross physical link and is primarily concerned with physical addressing and the order delivery of frames?

7. Which layer is used for reliable communication between end nodes over the network and provides mechanisms for establishing, maintaining, and terminating virtual circuits as-well-as controlling the flow of information? 

8. Which layer provides logical addressing that routers use for path determinations

9. Which layer specifies voltage, wire speed, and connector pin-outs and moves bits between devices?

10. Which layer combines bits into bytes and bytes into frames and uses MAC Addressing?
